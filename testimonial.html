              <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLynda was a pleasure to work with while designing our new website, as we had a
                great business & friendly relationship which really helped, her understanding and
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspknowledge of what we were looking for was so important.</p>

  <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn our first meeting with Lynda we knew that we had found a
professional website designer Lynda explained exactly what she would design & what we
would require as a taxi company to have an online booking website that would look professional
and show the customer that we can provide a reliable service for airport transfer & tours.</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe did not even have to tell or explain to Lynda about the
online booking software that we wanted to use for the website as Lynda knew all about this company and how there &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp software works.</p>

         <p>From my very first meeting with Lynda I was impressed with the level of professionalism and
           attention to detail. She had the patience and will to listen, taking on
            board what we wanted and she outlined the options available to us in a clear and
            concise manner.</p>

<p>We are very pleased with the website and are delighted with the excellent results it
has been producing for us. It has the professional look that we were expecting. Many of our
visitors have also complimented us on the website and how easy it was for them to use.</p>

         Lynda Foran of Foran Enterprise, has worked with our school for over five years. Her advice and

           her knowledge and understanding meant that any technical difficulty was addressed and solved
            promptly in a kind and friendly manner.I recommend Lynda highly and without hesitation and

          <p>We have worked with Lynda Foran for many years now on our website. Not only does Lynda always
            find a way to accomplish what we’re looking for, but she comes up with other ideas and suggestions
             that we don’t think of.
          </p>
          <p>I find her to be most patient, helpful and professional. She provides an efficient service
            within a reasonable time frame and she always responds to queries.

          <p>We received top class service from Lynda during the
            development of our website and great follow up support when our site was up and running.</p>
            <p>
              Our site is very user friendly, it really enhances our product range and more importantly
              achieved its objective in generating new sales leads and winning new
                Business for Barmate.
